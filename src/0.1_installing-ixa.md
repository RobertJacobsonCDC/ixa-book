# Installing Ixa

#### 1. Clone the Ixa repo to your local machine.

Open a terminal and change directories to wherever you want Ixa's source code to reside. Then run this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/ixa.git
```

There should now be a new directory called `ixa`. 

#### 2. Check that Ixa can compile and run.

Change directory to the new `ixa` directory and try to run an example:

```bash
cd ixa
cargo run --example basic-infection
```

While this example doesn't display much, it should run without any errors.
